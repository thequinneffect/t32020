style {
	- use a capital letter and plural for table names e.g. Students
	- use camel case for attributes e.g. firstName (but for this assignment use snake case e.g. first_name)
	OR after the relationship being modelled e.g. teaches
	- primary and foreign keys are defined at the bottom of the table
	- name foreign keys after the table being referenced e.g. staff or staff_id
	- foreign keys in entity tables are named after the relationship e.g. enrolledIn or enrolled_in
	- foreign keys in relationship tables are named "table"_id e.g. studentsId or students_id
}

reminders {
	- you cannot do total participation in a many-to-many relationship (because the relationship
	table is separate to the entity table)
	- can use default for a default value
	- check () conditions cant contain select queries in psql
	- you can name constraints if you like to make them more readable e.g. yVal integer constraint xyorder check (yVal > xVal)
	- use text unless there is a size evident from the context
}

todo/clarifications {
	- how do i know whether something is important enough to be not null?
		- ofc things that are primary key or full participation must be not null, but they made the email and name for users not null?

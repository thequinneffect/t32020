# COMP3311 20T3 Final Exam Q10

(a)

fid -> from, to, distance, departs, arrives, price
from, to -> distance
aid -> aname, range
eid -> ename, salary
employee, aircraft -> employee, aircraft

(b)
Assumptions:
I've assumed that aircraft with a different aid could potentially have 
the same name i.e. multiple "747 Airbus"'s.
I've also assumed that people with the same id can have the same name
which seems pretty obvious.

from, to -> distance violates BCNF because it is not trivial
as distance does not appear on the LHS, nor is "from, to" a superkey
(it doesn't imply departs, arrives, or price).
The rest are superkeys so are okay.

A new schema possibility is;

Routes(rid, from, to, distance)
Flights(fid, route, departs, arrives, price)
Aircraft(aid, aname, range)
Certified(employee, aircraft)
Employees(eid, ename, salary)

which gives FD's;

rid -> from, to, distance
from, to -> distance
fid -> route, departs, arrives, price
aid -> aname, range
eid -> ename, salary
employee, aircraft -> employee, aircraft

and now it is in BCNF as rid is a super key, as is "from, to" because 
it doesn't need to imply departs, arrives, or price anymore,
and it does imply distance as required.

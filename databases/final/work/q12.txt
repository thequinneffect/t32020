# COMP3311 20T3 Final Exam Q12

(a)
It is not conflict serializable.
T2 -> T1
T1 -> T2
T1 -> T3
T2 -> T3
the first two form a cycle and hence not conflict serializable.

(b)

If possible, then it must be like one of the 3! = 6 options;
1: T1 T2 T3
2: T1 T3 T2 
3: T2 T1 T3 
4: T2 T3 T1 
5: T3 T1 T2 
6: T3 T2 T1

In concurrent schedule;
X: there are no reads for x, T3 writes final
Y: T2 reads inital, T1 writes final (and note T2 doesn't read T1's write)

As they all write X and T3 must write X final, 
it can only be option 1 or 3 (these have T3 writing final).
T2 must read Y first and note that in the concurrent version
it reads Y before T1 writes to it, and because the serializable
schedule must read the same version of a shared object, T2 must
read Y before T1 writes to it, meaning only option 3 is valid.

It is view serializable when the ordering is T2 T1 T3

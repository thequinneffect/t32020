The big question is: should your data be collected and monitored?

Suspicious sign in attempt/location has saved me more than enough times for it to be worth it. This is only possible
if they track my location. It would seem the intent behind storing the data and what it is used for matters. I want
them to notify me of sus login attempts, i don't want them to hand that location data off to some company in my 
area who then repeatedly calls me.

Advertisements {
	- they can be useful, i've definitely bought things that we advertised to me and i like them
	- they can also be annoying, should have the option to turn ads off

}

Mitigations {
	- stored data should be encrypted in a sophisticated manner so that hackers cannot benefit from it
	- adblock
}

Non-optional data {
	- by nature of the internet, some data has to be stored i.e. it would be very hard to run a site if you
	aren't allowed to store any data about users. Authentication requires storing data. 2FA requires storing a
	phone number. Products have to be shipped to an address (but i guess that doesn't strictly have to be
	stored).

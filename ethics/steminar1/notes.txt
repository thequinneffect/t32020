The big question is: should your data be collected and monitored?

Suspicious sign in attempt/location has saved me more than enough times for it to be worth it. This is only possible
if they track my location. It would seem the intent behind storing the data and what it is used for matters. I want
them to notify me of sus login attempts, i don't want them to hand that location data off to some company in my 
area who then repeatedly calls me.
This is a consequential approach because I am saying that it is only bad for them to collect my
data if they use it for a purpose i don't agree with.

Fishing attempts and scams {
	- It is scary how much information some scammers are able to gather about you or about a purchase you have made etc 
	in order to create a fake email asking for an account to refund into for example because the product has gone out of stock.
}

Data-breaches {
	- should they store certain information if it has the potential to be obtained by hackers in a data breach?
	- if you're involved in a data breach, a company has to inform you. I've gotten emails like this.
}

Advertisements {
	- they can be useful, i've definitely bought things that we advertised to me and i like them
	- they can also be annoying, should have the option to turn ads off

}

Mitigations {
	- stored data should be encrypted in a sophisticated manner so that hackers cannot benefit from it
	- adblock
}

Non-optional data {
	- by nature of the internet, some data has to be stored i.e. it would be very hard to run a site if you
	aren't allowed to store any data about users. Authentication requires storing data. 2FA requires storing a
	phone number. Products have to be shipped to an address (but i guess that doesn't strictly have to be
	stored).
}

unethical {
	- it is certainly unethical to bury what data will be collected in a huge ToS sheet. No one reads those. It needs to be 
	simpler and straight to the point.
}

- get data on an on-need basis
- unethical echo-chambers. but does intention matter when deciding unethicalness? echo chambers are kindn of a byproduct of 
algorithm that are out of our control, it wasn't really the intention for echo chambers to form, they just did naturally
form because of how the algorithms work (only serve up what people already like).

- taking different roles! i'll pretend to be x, they'll pretend to be y -> each role comes to a different conclusion
- activity: fake data-dump of a person?



Dataveillance from a companies point of view;

Dataveillance is ethical because it has good outcomes. These outcomes are;

Improved security
- how many times have you received a suspicious sign-in attempt email because someone
who is believed not to be you signed into your account? They were only able to be stopped because
their ip/location doesn't match your usual one. We can only know this if we store it.
- how many times have you received a 2FA code when you haven't attempted to sign in? Clearly
someone else is trying to sign into your account, and now they can't because they don't have the
2fa code that was sent to your mobile. This is only possible if we can have your mobile number. 

Improved Experience
- By collecting information about you, we are able to tailor your online experience just
to suit your needs e.g. recommending videos that you will find interesting
- COUNTER ARGUMENT: this can lead onto a counter argument by the consumer, in which they
argue that echo-chambers are causing far more damage than it is worth e.g. polarisation

Improved advertising
- Everybody hates getting ads, but with more data we can more accurately predict what you're 
interested in and serve up ads based on that!
- COUNTER ARUGMENT: consumer can argue that they don't want personalised ads. Perhaps they are
into something that they consider embarassing and they don't want ads shown for that on their
devices because people might see them and then know they are interested in said thing. Furthermore,
the ad profiles are somewhat inaccurate.
